This is a simple Yahtzee game built in Ruby on Rails. It has a leaderboard for high scores and allows users to save in-progress games to finish later. I realize any web-savvy user could easily submit a bogus score to get on the leaderboard, but curbing cheating wasn't something I was interested in for this exercise.
